## Major Projects
1. Gaze-On-Objects.

**Role: Researcher and Lead Author** 

The Gaze-on-Objects (GOO) dataset consists of synthetic and real images of people looking at objects in a retail environment. The dataset is used for traning and evaluation on the task of Gaze Object Prediction: given a single image with a person and this person's head location, the object beng gazed at must be determined. 

2. CitySim PH

**Role: Researcher **

The CitySim PH project aims to create a simulated environment for training self-driving vehicles and UAVs to navigate around urban streets in the Philippines. This project is currently on hold. 

3. Binarized-MobileNet SSD 

**Role: Researcher**

An undergraduate thesis on converting lightweight object detection networks (SSD-MobileNet) into partial binary neural networks (BNNs) to achieve faster inference times on limited compute (CPU only).
